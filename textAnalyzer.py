#Use the correct() method to attempt spelling correction.
# nltk.download('punkt') -> for punctuation
# nltk needed to download punkt
# why I choosed flask (elegance and simplicity, not familiar with python)


#process the data, validate the data 
#add to CV git, flask, rest
#authentification?
#support only sentences
